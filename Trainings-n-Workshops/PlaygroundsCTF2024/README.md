# 🛝 PlaygroundsCTF 2024

Welcome to the **PlaygroundsCTF 2024** challenge set!  
This directory contains all the challenges I created for this year's event — a Capture The Flag competition designed specifically for beginner students at **PSUT**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

PlaygroundsCTF is all about **learning by doing**. The goal is to provide a friendly, hands-on introduction to cybersecurity concepts. Many of these challenges are intentionally straightforward, with a strong focus on building **confidence**, **fundamental skills**, and **problem-solving habits**.

---

## 🤖 Using AI to Learn

Throughout some of the challenge write-ups, you’ll notice I’ve incorporated the use of **AI tools like ChatGPT**. These tools can help:

- Explain complex concepts in simple terms  
- Guide students toward the solution without giving it away  
- Reinforce the habit of asking good questions and seeking help effectively  

💡 *Think of AI as a friendly teammate — not a cheat code.*

## 📁 Challenge Layout

Each challenge is placed in its own folder and may include:

- `README.md` – Description of the challenge
- `challenge` or `files/` – Any provided files
- `writeup.md` – Solution guide and walkthrough
- `flag.txt` – The flag (for validation purposes only)

---

## 🏁 For Students

This CTF isn’t about being perfect — it’s about being curious.

If you get stuck:
- Take a break and come back later
- Try looking at the problem from a different angle
- Use the write-ups to **learn**, not just to get the flag
- Ask ChatGPT or your peers questions — learning is a team sport!
